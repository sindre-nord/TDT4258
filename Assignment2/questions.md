### Question 1
Why can a cache respond faster to the reads and writes from
the processor than the main memory? How many reasons do you find?
Why donâ€™t we just use cache if it is faster?

### Answer 1
The cache typically utelizes a much faster memory technology. Reading and writing is much faster. Also, it's
commonly placed much closer to the physical processor. The cavieat is price.
#### Pros giving speed
- It's based on faster technology
- It's closer
#### Cons, why not always use it:
- It's far more expensive

### Question 2
Why do we want to simulate the cache in software instead
of running it on actual hardware and just observe how the hardware
behaves?
### Answer 2
If we where to try to simulate the cache in hardware, we would have to build a physical model of the cache. This would be very expensive and time consuming. Also, we would have to build a model for each different type of cache. By simulating it in software, we can easily change the model and run it on any computer. This is much cheaper and faster.
